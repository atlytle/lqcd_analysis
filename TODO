TODO:
 * Add code for hdf5 caching of correlators
 * Refactor and add code for database I/O
 * Add code for "serialization" of fits into the database
 * Add and refactor code for processing an embedded database into
   a centralized Postgres database
 * Verify that the refactored correlator code (meff, avg, etc...) works properly
   with folded correlators

DONE:
 * Profile, optimize, and clean up shrinkage code (this has become a
    bottleneck in production runs). The problem was that apparently np.einsum 
    was unexpectedly very slow.
 * Add support for logger. Check out the example configuration file,
   logging_config.ini. This file (or something like it) should be included in 
   any application (e.g., a script) which uses this library. Something like 
   this should work:
   import logging
   import logging.config
   with open('config_ini') as ifile:
       logging.config.fileConfig(ifile, disable_existing_loggers=False)`
